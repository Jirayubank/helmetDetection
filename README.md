# Helmet Detection with YOLOv8

Welcome to the **helmetDetection** repository â€“ a project leveraging YOLOv8 for detecting helmet-wearing individuals. This initiative brings together Arduino, Python, and AI object detection to create an intelligent security system.

## Getting Started

1. Head to the `scripts` directory for the primary program.
2. Explore the `Dataset` from [Roboflow](https://universe.roboflow.com/bvoqueworkspace/helmet-wearing-detection-7yx0s/dataset).
3. Check out the [Training Notebook](https://github.com/Jirayubank/helmetDetectionNotebook) for insights into the training process.
4. The *helmetDetection* Yolov8 model also available in `scripts`.

## Project Components

- **Main Program**: Navigate to the `scripts` directory to access the core functionality.
- **Arduino Integration**: Connect your Arduino to enhance the capabilities of the security system.
- **YOLOv8 Documentation**: Refer to the official [YOLOv8 documentation](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics) for comprehensive details.

## Dataset

Our dataset, sourced from [Roboflow](https://universe.roboflow.com/bvoqueworkspace/helmet-wearing-detection-7yx0s/dataset). The structured dataset ensures robust training and validation.

## Training

Explore the training process in the [Training Notebook](https://github.com/Jirayubank/helmetDetectionNotebook) to understand how the model learns from the dataset.
